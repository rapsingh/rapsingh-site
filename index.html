    <h1> Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</h1>
    <p>One of my favourite books is Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone by J.K. Rowling. It is a story about Harry Potter, an orphan brought up by his aunt and uncle because his parents were killed when he was a baby. Harry is unloved by his uncle and aunt but everything changes when he is invited to join Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and he ascertains he's a wizard. At Hogwarts, Harry realises he's special and his adventures commence when he and his incipient friends Ron and Hermione endeavour to unravel the mystery of the Philosopher's Stone.</p> 
    <p>I can read this book perpetually again. From the very beginning until the terminus J.K. Rowling has me pretended! There is never a dull moment, whether it's battling with trolls, a three-headed canine, or Harry facing Lord Voldermort. I would recommend this book because it keeps you reading without ever wanting to put the book down. By the terminus of the book, you come to profoundly relish the characters and make you read more of it.

    If you haven't read any of the Harry Potter books you are missing out on the best series ever!</p>
